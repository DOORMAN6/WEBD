                 decorated. According to information collected in 1985,
                  this village was once located in the Cowichan Valley 
                  at the spot where the Silver Bridge currently crosses
                   the Cowichan River southeast of Duncan. According to

                   Cowichan and Chemainus people (Siyóletse and St’éts’en
                    respectively) originated from this village.
